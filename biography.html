        <h1>Tam Austria</h1>
        <p>A highly skilled figurative artist who excels in the dynamics of realism, Tam (for Anastacio) Austria is a collectors’ favorite. His followers do not seem to find the long wait for an Austria work. This is, concededly, the best proof that
          the son
          of peasant parents from Tanay, Rizal, had indeed gone a long way from his humble origins.
          Austria’s artistic odyssey began in the 1950s. The boy Austria turned out a highly realistic oil painting of Christ with a crown of thorns – an impressive first work for one who was not even 10 years old. The parish priest, who must have
          noticed
          the early signs of artistic talent in Austria who served him as altar boy, gave the youth his first exposure to art. The generous priest was also instrumental in winning a four-year high scholar scholarship for the evolving artist. In 1960,
          Austria
          enrolled at the University of Sto. Tomas for a degree in fine arts. He was a standout and easily won a number of prizes for his early efforts.

        <p>Sometime in 1970, Austria mounted his first exhibition at Marcel’s Gallery of Fine Arts in Oakland, California. In the same year, he represented the Filipino community in the International Art Festival in Berkeley, California. This was
          soon
          followed by exhibitions in San Francisco, California, as well as the Hidalgo Gallery in Makati (1972), the Galerie Beue (1973), Hyatt Regency (1975) and Sining Kamalig (1976). A high point in his career was his nomination as one of the five
          finalists in the 1983 Mobil Art Awards.
          Austria’s work reveals the artist’s preoccupation with the myths and legends of his people, the mother and child, the peasant folk, their customs and traditions, the colorful panorama of rural landscape. They figure prominently in his works
          because
          of their timeless and universal appeal, he explains. “I think my work reflects a number of basic truths, perhaps, too, nostalgia for the good things slipping away. Then there is the earth, the fields, the sky, the quiet corner people long
          for.
          Perhaps people are drawn to my painting by common feelings that go beyond art.”</p>

      <p>It is a dream that will never slumber forever, neither be ever lost into forgetfulness.<br>

        It has been a recurring dream that have counted years. A good dream. And the dream became a vision-and it stayed with me all those times I have spent painting-through austerity and consolation.<br>
        This vision has been in my mind for a long time-it has never waned. Like any fine wine, I believe it is on the ripe old age. This is the right time to make the vision a reality. So that others may benefit too.

        An Inspired Journey
        Life is a journey so they say, and it truly is. Like all journeys, every step is different, pace not permanent, obstacles here and there. No matter how hard a journey is, it becomes light and fulfilling when you do it with inspiration. I for
        one was no exception. I have been through tough times in my life before I met peace and contentment, and that is manifested in the certitude that I worked hard and dedicated—in point of fact because I am inspired.
        As we go through our personal 'Book of Life' we come and go in successive chapters. In the living, as one chapter ends, another begins. A new chapter in mine simply begins on a bedrock-a solid rock foundation beneath a compressible soil. The
        bedrock stands for firmness, stability and strength. The soil represents uncertainties. In our life they are both present.

        The vision lingers, and is firm
        I would call my vision 'my Bedrocks' because it stands for many strong attributes. While the word 'bedrock' stands for solidity, it also stands for something more significant as an abbreviation.

        ‘B’ stands for the ‘Basic’ solid art formation—it is deeply rooted in RECREAMINDOISM ReNA. It is my personal philosophy, my ‘Inspirer’, my own safeguard for an aspiration to share to others.

        ‘E’ stands for ‘Explainable, heartfelt vision.’ One that is easily grasp by people from all walks of life. Appreciating what is true to life and beautiful.

        ‘D’ stands for ‘Determined’ self-less act. I am consummately done with the mindset of “self first” and now passionately involved in sharing the truth that a life lived with inspiration beats all obstacles of mess and misdirection.

        ‘R’ stands for ‘RECREAMINDOISM ReNa.’ It is my beacon in search for contentment, valuing one’s artistic intuition and respect for life.
        ‘O’ stands for the ‘Overriding concern’ to impart the substance of the philosophy, to supplement every individual’s natural talent and gift.

        ‘C’ stands for ‘Content’ the very purpose of this summation is to impart the very content of the vision that yours truly want to convey to others.

        ‘K’ stands for ‘Knowledge’ the understanding of it all. The realization of the fact that by sharing what was learned and visualized could help others to be more creative and pursue their aspirations in life.
        And the ‘S’ stands for the ‘Solid summary of thoughts’ all the collation of thoughts and ideas in my mind, I am willing to impart to everyone who is willing to listen and understand. Whoever I am now, it is because I believed in them!

        Through a vision a mission was born. And a series of missions followed.
        To share the lessons of life in order to augment a talent to create through the usage of the book, RECREAMINDOISM ReNA. It simply teaches us to become inspired under all circumstances. Most significantly, when circumstances does not favor us.
        Remain inspired.

        Through this vision you become a 'Buster of Inhumanity.' A model of fairness, promoter of the truth and the just-a vanguard of peace;
        You become an 'Indestructible You,' with your talent nothing can discourage you to stop what you yearn the most-to create;
        Against corruption, you are the 'Incorruptible You.' And against divergence , you are the 'Inseparable You.' The yearning of the body does not conflict with the need of the soul. It is just and moral, the very worth of being humane. The 'YOU'
        also stands for "Yearnings One's Understanding.'

        A Monumental Landmark
        The vision calls for an 'Art Reservoir,' an imposing structure that will house several galleries and a museum-a permanent home for art treasures, a grand place to exhibit works of arts for people to see, and a haven for artists both
        professional or a budding beginner.
        In one monumental landmark we put up several galleries for the artists of the country, and the rest of the world. A museum that represents our cultural heritage, our art treasures, of past, present and future. It is the reflection of our
        society, who we are, where do we come from, what we are before, and what we have become now.

        Philosophy of your work:
        In practice, my inspirer art of Recreamindoism Rena Brain child - by product of my seemingly endless passion in art that holds on THE BEST ABILITY & POWER of inspiration based on principles. The philosophical elements behind art. Dee- insight
        that expresses that abstract theory to a layman's language of inspiration or breath of life that rhymes to life. the balance between the body and soul is inseparable, because they are meant to be as one. It's art's intrinsic wholeness with
        form and beauty- humanity's worth. At the back of this inspiration on what inspired me most, that helps the artist finds the reason why he paints or why it's created such work with gift of fertility. To exist and mainly with mission in
        prompting the spirit to others and unstoppable good dream is immeasurable in reaching the hallmark
        classification of respect - all artists wish to achieve love.

        I no longer search for fame or personal gain, only the good intention to impart. I am blessed with such a colorful life, both literally and metaphorically speaking. And in a society where we belong, it is only but fitting to contribute
        something beneficial to everyone.
        Be inspired! That is the main mission. The galleries can give us the chance to teach people the value of talent and opportunity, and the museum to rediscover the past for its valuable lessons, the significance of the now, and a glimpse of the
        forthcoming.
        Time immemorial when this vision was like a haunted drape floating over my consciousness, I must admit I was tempted to talk this out to the former First Lady of the Philippines, Imelda Romualdez Marcos . It was way back the 70's era. But
        then everything was new at its infancy, the Cultural Center of the Philippines, performance theaters, the arts patronage. As time goes by and so thus my age added up, the idea of having an arts and cultural landmark worthy of the country's
        recognition never withers. As days, months and years progressed I was able to build a good foundation on how to accomplish this vision, and I call it my 'Four Pillars of Representation.'
        The first pillar is the 'Meetings of the Mind.' and I started it out by calling the attention of my friends and colleagues in the arts world. Public leaders I started calling, and the patrons of the arts peddling them the idea. I discussed it
        with community leaders, business leaders, influencers, teachers and students as well. The idea was to converge them in one time and opportunity so that different views may then be laid out for discussion. The second pillar is the creation of
        a ‘Manifesto’ —when the ‘thinking minds’ meet and agree on the aim of making it a reality, we make a public declaration of commitment. A covenant, so to speak, between people who understand value of cooperation, believes in creativity of men
        and the appreciation of individual talents may be rolled into one historic and monumental structure.
        The third pillar is to bring in a ‘Mandate’—a legal authority to carry out the realization of the vision. This is only made possible when we seek the participation and concurrence of our political leaders. And that they too believe in our
        endeavor.
        The fourth pillar is the ‘Multitudes’ of gratefulness, of hope, inspiration and humility. We seek no monetary rewards here, only appreciation in numbers make unforgettable consolation to our hearts.
        A fifth pillar, an added foundation but with immeasurable amount of significance, is owing all the efforts made fruitful in the ‘Mercy’ of God.
        And then the pandemic strikes…
        “…and dreaming amidst the pandemic is not so bad if one dreams a good dream only to make it come true”
        And then it hits us. Nobody sees it coming. The world at present, with all the sophisticated advances in technology and know-who were no match against the ravages of the pandemic. Money cannot even save those who were afflicted.

        I feel the loss of the people of the world. Their pain resonates all over the news-it is overwhelming. You cannot fall on deaf ears. Even the mightiest of countries, bowed down to the unseen.
        I have high hopes for mankind. This is the moment that we need to be strong—the human heart shows its true color when faced with such a predicament like walking on the edge of a precipice, and the color is brilliant! A sign that it wants to
        survive so it keeps on going.
        Humans are normally resilient. We are tough. But for every tribulation in life, toughness is tested on different levels. This time, we need not just toughness but clear thinking. Discipline, of both mind and body, is what we need in this
        trying times.
        Amidst the calamities hitting us and diseases going astray we need to give our people the reason to continue living with inspiration, and that is through pursuing with passion the ability to be creative-painting what is true to life and
        beautiful.
        This too shall come to pass ..
        Now that the world stood still, and trying to move forward inch by inch towards the old normal, nobody knows if we could ever get back at it. As our advocacy has come to a stall, with all those beautiful plans in the mind with the wanting to
        get it realized, it is still worth the wait.
        We may lose hope, get frustrated, lose focus in our lives. But most humbling, whatever is happening to us now teaches us to preserve the creations from the heart. To be able to inspire still and influence, that is the most important. We
        become down and feeling desperate at one point in our life. Whether this pandemic ends or not, I am positive the heartfelt vision will prevail. There is always a way to find our inner peace in each one of us, and it starts by appreciating
        what we have in us, and what we have in our surroundings. When we do this, we become truly inspired—there is harmony in us, no conflict of the mind and heart. We achieve, whatever it is that we wanted. And we complete this by staying positive
        and take good care of our body. There is no weak body that takes care of itself and persevere.
        When we do this, when we extend help to others, you imprint your name in history as one of the partners of such a monumental endeavor that would not only preserve legacies, but will continue to inspire!

        When did you start painting professionally?
        I've been painting since I was a child. I took up fine arts at UST in 1964. New doors of opportunity opened up that inspired me. I believed this is the natural calling of my profession as an artist. I saw the
        appreciation and enthusiasm of people that build my confidence. This inspired me to push and entered the realm of art. I decided to finally focus on this field rather than engage in other business outfit.

        How do you view art and beauty as a whole?
        Viewing art and beauty as a whole is the bedrock solid foundation of humanity. The body's spinal column where all nerves connects and supplies life with energy to function inspiring other parts like other artists derive their inspiration and
        determination to create a true to life called obra. The art that signifies the body that shows the pure strength in the eyes of the beholder that give joy, harmony between these inspired body and soul. These give one a sense of well-being.
        The objective is to portray reality to reflect absolute intelligence that links doubts, emptiness in the human world.
